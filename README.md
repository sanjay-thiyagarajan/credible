### About
<p> Credible is an integrated platform for enabling the companies to analyse the standard aspects of business model such as Resume Analysis, Customer review analysis, Sentiment analysis on write-ups and consolidated tweet analysis using expert.ai Natural Language API.</p>

### expert.ai Natural Language API

[expert.ai Natural Language API](https://docs.expert.ai/nlapi/latest/) is a cloud-based software service providing a comprehensive set of natural language understanding capabilities based on expert.ai technology.

<p> The expert.ai Natural Language API is a cloud-based service with a REST interface. This means that in order to use it a program must be able to access the Web and carry out an HTTP conversation with the API interface.</p>

<p>Whenever the program has to analyze a document, classify a document or detect information inside a document, it must request the most suitable API resource, similarly to what you do when you request the page of a site with a Web browser.</p>

### Installation Instructions
The portal is primarily a django based application, and to set it up we require to have 
python environment with django and other project dependencies installed. Though one can
work with the project without an virtual environment,  it is recommended to use one so 
as to avoid conflicts with other projects.

0. Make sure that you have `Python 3`, `python-3-devel`, `gcc`, `virtualenv`, and `pip` installed.     
1. Clone the repository

 ```
        $ git clone https://github.com/sanjay-thiyagarajan/credible.git
        $ cd credible
 ```
2. Create a python 3 virtualenv, and activate the environment.
 ```bash
        $ virtualenv -p python3
        $ source bin/activate
 ```   
3. Install the project dependencies
    ```
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
### After Setting Up
From now when you start your work, run ``source bin/activate`` inside the project repository and you can work with the django application as usual - 

* `python manage.py migrate` - set up database
* `python manage.py createsuperuser` - create admin user
* `python manage.py runserver`  - run the project locally
